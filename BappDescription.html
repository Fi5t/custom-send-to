<p>Adds a customizable "Send to..."-context-menu to your BurpSuite.</p>

<p><b>Configuration</b></p>

<p>After loading the extension the "Send to"-Tab contains all necessary options to configure the "Send to"-context-menu. </p>

<p>New context-menu-entries can be added using the "Add"-button. Each entry consists of following fields:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> the name of the context-menu-entry</li>

    <li><strong>Command:</strong> the command to be executed. You can use following placeholders:


        <ul>
            <li><strong>%S:</strong> will be replaced with the selected text</li>

            <li><strong>%F:</strong> will be replaced with the path to a temporary file which contains the selected text</li></ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Run in terminal:</strong> defines whether a terminal-window should appear in which the configured command is executed. By default "xterm" is used as terminal-emulator. You can change the terminal-emulator in the "Miscellaneous Options" to your liking.</li>

    <li><strong>Show preview:</strong> gives you the chance to preview and change the command before executing it</li>

    <li><strong>Output should replace selection:</strong> will replace the selection with the output of the to be executed command</li>
</ul>

<p>After creating new context-menu-entries using the "Add"-button they can be edited or deleted again using the "Edit"- and "Remove"-button. In addition the order in which they appear in the context-menu can be altered using the "Up"- and "Down"-button.</p>

<p><b>Context-Menu</b></p>

<p>The "Send to..." context-menu contains all entries which were added in the "Send to"-Tab.
    In addition you can add new entries via the "Custom command..."-context-menu-entry.</p>

<p><b>Save and load options</b></p>

<p>Usually the options of the "Send to"-Tab are saved automatically. However, if you switch computers you may save and load your current options. This can be done by clicking on the gear-symbol in the upper-left corner of the "Send to"-Tab and select the appropriate context-menu-entry.</p>

<p><b>Security Notes</b></p>

<p>Executing commands based on untrusted input always introduces the risk of command injection. This is especially true when using the <strong>%S</strong> placeholder. Thus it is recommended to always activate the <strong>Show preview</strong> option when using the <strong>%S</strong> placeholder and closely analyse commands in the preview window prior to execution.</p>
